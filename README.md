# React useEffect Hook: Missing Logic for Count <= 0

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React's `useEffect` hook where the conditional rendering logic is incomplete. The component successfully handles the case where the count is greater than 0, but it lacks the necessary logic to handle scenarios where the count is less than or equal to 0.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` uses `useState` and `useEffect` to manage a counter.  The `useEffect` hook includes a conditional statement that only executes when the `count` is greater than 0.  This is incomplete and may lead to unexpected behavior or missing functionality. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding logic to handle cases where `count` is less than or equal to 0.  This might involve different actions or simply adding a `console.log` to show that this case has been encountered.
